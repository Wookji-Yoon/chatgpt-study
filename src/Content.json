The tasks include recruitment, personnel management (evaluation, promotion, dismissal, personnel appointment), salary, in-house welfare, contractor management, education and safety management, and labor. Among them, I am very interested in HRD, so I hope to perform the human resources department at a large company after graduation. Nevertheless, I didn't have many opportunities to actually experience HR work, so I found out about the next generation HR Academy. Since this is the only HR association club in Korea, I would like to develop capabilities, foster proper ethical awareness as a human resources expert, and share knowledge and information on human resources with my team members if I am given the opportunity to do personnel affairs. As the next generation HR Academy mentions, I pledge to build trust in each other with a love for others, do my best with passion, exchange positive influences, and become a person who moves on their own to grow together.",
            "q2": "Interviews are essential procedures for the interviewer to hire the right person for the job or corporate culture by asking various questions to identify the applicant's attitude or thoughts. However, due to the recent controversy over the objectivity of interviewers along with the impact of the coronavirus, more and more companies are conducting \"AI interviews\" in which AI conducts interviews, not people. This is a new interview technique in which AI analyzes the applicant's facial expression, voice, and emotional state in real time within a limited time, and has the advantage of protruding a fair and objective evaluation of job seekers without the interviewer's supervision. AI interviews can analyze frontal lobes to measure applicants' motivation, reasoning, and control in the process of screening applicants' decision-making methods, allowing companies to better understand the consistency and job competence they want. AI interviews should be introduced to ensure objectivity and fairness in recruitment.",

However, there was no mock U.N. activity at the high school branch where they transferred to enhance their understanding of China. Having encountered social issues from various perspectives through the mock UN, I proposed a mock UN club and visited a teacher who would be in charge of it, informed the purpose of the club, and asked for help. However, it was difficult to recruit students who were not confident in English as club members. I made a club with 6 students who were interested in it. After three meetings with the high school's mock U.N. representative, three were given the opportunity to participate as Korean representatives, exploring the historical background of the two countries, international relations between the Middle East and Israel, and other related policies. I was able to receive an unexpected special award as a representative presenter, and the confident mock U.N. club participated in various on-campus mock U.N. competitions and had various experiences. I don't think there's that much difference between going back and making a new road without a path. However, the experience of creating a new path and the confidence that I gained from it has eliminated my fear of challenging new things and created confidence to try any challenges.",

In particular, I applied as a mentor for the 21st School-Life Mentoring Program (SMP) after being discharged from the military because I wanted to abandon the existing consciousness that I thought was difficult to do community service once again. I aimed to introduce various fields of practice to mentees who lacked information on the field and content of the SMP activities, and to provide clues that ultimately become voluntary and continuous activities by choosing activities that suit their abilities and aptitudes. Through this, I aimed to develop my knowledge as a volunteer by reviewing the basic attitude and values necessary for social service activities once again, and to develop respect and altruism for humans. The new experience of participating in community service activities organized by Seoul National University provided an opportunity to look at the lives of myself and others, and I wanted to broaden my horizons by becoming interested in my neighbors. I met mentees who work in school life in a different way from myself, got away from self-centered thinking and understood them, and I was able to have a sense of community that we should live together as members of society by recognizing them as \"us\" rather than \"others.\""

            "q1": "[Communication]\n\nUnlike marketing and sales, HR has many variables because it communicates in human relationships, and communicates with many departments to prepare for those variables. I think communication is the ability to convey the information you want to convey without errors. Therefore, it is important not only to learn communication in theory, but also to learn in practice. I applied for the next generation HR Academy activities because there are projects where you can experience not only HR expertise but also practical experience, so I can capture both expertise and practical experience. \n\n\nThrough activities, I want to indirectly experience HR work, simulate various tasks, find a field that I can contribute to, and find a direction to grow into an expert in that field, and draw a clear future. The first step to becoming an expert is to create communication skills, and I will reinterpret and embody the abstract meaning of communication in my own words.",

For example, the scope of the job is clearly divided to carry out the recruitment work, and the recruitment strategy is established after identifying which job requires which talent. Therefore, careful decision-making is made by communicating with leaders in various fields.\n\nI was proud that the new employee was adapting better than when I achieved high sales while working part-time in sales. I participated in the process of recruiting new employees and created a guidebook to help new employees adapt to their work. I became interested in the field of HRM as employees became attracted to the process of learning and developing their work through booklets and the result leading to sales.",

If one person could do everything perfectly, there would be no need for organizations and businesses. However, it is difficult for one person to do everything perfectly, so many people work together to achieve one goal. \n\n\nI have done many group projects, carried out projects with various people, and worked as a team leader several times. I couldn't cooperate, so I proceeded with the project alone. However, I was able to finish the project with the highest score when the members performed their duties and communicated and cooperated based on the materials they organized rather than when working on the project alone. There were members who were good at planning by decomposing their roles, but there were team members who were afraid of presenting in front of many people, and there were team members who had excellent data collection skills but were difficult to derive insights from the data. I realized that I could identify areas where my team members can do well and produce better results when given the right role. \n\n\nTherefore, I think cooperating together creates a greater synergy effect when each person's role is clear, the scope they can and cannot do is clear, and respects the other person's role and scope.",

Although I had been educated in foreign languages for a long time, it was difficult to even speak a word in front of foreigners. So I thought I should learn a flexible way of thinking about language in Japan, which I have never learned. \n\nA week before I was an exchange student, I arrived in Japan alone and tested how well I could adapt without anyone's help. However, there are so many words I don't know, and it was hard for the locals to adapt because they spoke so fast. I got a Japanese tutor to adapt to Japanese life. In order to utilize what I learned from the tutor, I went to actual Japanese regional festivals and tried to spit out what I learned while doing club activities. Even if my skills don't improve quickly, I did my best to do what I can now without being impatient. I found it interesting to learn a language by talking to the Japanese and using what I learned every day, not just in class. This experience in Japan helped me to respond to Japanese customers when I returned to Korea. \n\nThrough this experience, I felt a sense of accomplishment that followed the result of my actions, thinking that I could grow step by step without being impatient."

            "q2": "[Evaluation]\n\nMost companies have adopted the performance-based annual salary system, which is a relative evaluation, but I think interest in absolute evaluation is increasing recently. The reason is that the performance-based annual salary system can motivate employees, but relative evaluation can cause side effects that can lead to loss of motivation and poor work efficiency. \n\n\nIn this regard, I would like to change the employee's perception by changing the purpose of the evaluation from 'discriminatory compensation' to 'competency development' to redefine the purpose of performance management to help employees develop.

At that time, each team had only internal meetings. As we only dealt with promotional and event progress at planning team meetings, it was difficult for our team to solve promotional posters and budget problems with our own capabilities. As a result, I felt the need for a team-to-team meeting and promoted the 'team alliance meeting'. First of all, I asked for the production after discussing the poster with the media team. Also, we had a meeting with the finance team about the event budget. Lastly, I put up posters with all the members of the ambassador.\n\n\nPeople with different roles in different teams worked together and shared all the progress to successfully complete the campus tour.

In this regard, I have experienced successfully selling products on 11th Street through creative ideas, not just thinking. We had a lucky box event ahead of the holiday. However, the size of the box is too big, so customers hesitate to buy it and it is difficult to sell it.\n\n\nI used the delivery service and SNS to boost sales. We used the delivery service in the existing store to deliver it to the customer's house and promoted it to various customers using SNS. As a result, customers who were less burdened to carry and those who became interested in the product after seeing SNS purchased the product and were able to sell all the inventory at that time. I could have given up for a moment, but it was a valuable experience to make results using everything around me that I could use."

The purpose of the global business I'm learning is a global understanding of the company. I thought that the HR academy activities were very necessary for Durana to understand practical matters in theory about the content of personnel management, which is an area of interest among global business majors. I have experience working in production before attending school. What I felt was that there was a certain gap between the theory of personnel and the practice. Not long ago, I talked to a daily lady who works at the Coupang Distribution Center. It was right to master one person by working long hours in one part, but the person in charge moved the worker several times, overlooking the complaint.

Human resource management is closely related to personal quality of life, corporate survival, and social welfare. And the selection management that I want to explain plays a very important role in meeting the goals of human resource management. To briefly explain the selection management, the process of selecting the best person for the job requires clear consideration of the effectiveness of the selected personnel and the minimization of costs. As I said earlier in the motivation for applying, I was interested in the selection management because I thought that the most important thing was to make the rotation situation of daily workers have expertise in one part without making it overturned. I realized the need to experience the importance of personnel in the practice of working in production, and I thought I should know how important it is to narrow the personnel gap between the practice and the theory.",

What I felt through the team project was the harmony of tolerance and subjectivity to listen and accept the opinions of the majority, and the ultimate value of this was the tolerance and concession to accept the opinions of the majority without prejudice. Projects that work together with your team should never be claimed by only one person. Therefore, the most important thing in this cooperation was to realize that the other person's opinion was not wrong, but that it was a different opinion from me. As soon as I realized that, as the leader of the team, I had a wise attitude to accept the opinions of the team members and yield my opinions one step by step. To concede my opinion does not mean indecision. It is to acknowledge that the other person and I are different and that there is something that can be learned through such differences. So I decided to transfer to another school and become a leader of a team that leads each other's departments, and to become a wise leader who embraces and leads the majority in various activities. My goal of being a leader is not because I am above others or because I want to be a leader. In my experience, no matter what you do, your responsibility and performance are different when you are in the leading group and represent others. I will become a leader who creates the value of cooperation through this sense of responsibility and concession.",

To become a developmental talent, I entered Yeungnam University of Science and Technology, continued to manage credits for transfer, obtained IT-related certificates to become a global business-level talent, and took special lectures on finance and accounting during vacation. In particular, I was able to have practical experience in finance by taking special financial lectures to make use of the strengths of my major field, and I took marketing lectures during the semester to carry out team projects for prospective entrepreneurs. As a result, I learned how to use statistical techniques such as regression analysis, and I was able to produce various types of portfolios. I thought that the various activities I tried in the previous college were also extended in the curriculum to learn at Korea University Sejong. Looking back on all those activities, I will continue to use the school's competency system efficiently for my dream without being complacent in the present. If you can develop yourself by taking advantage of your strengths, I think it will be a great foundation for becoming a talented person who has the ability to become a talent demanded by society.

When I started dreaming of being a human resources manager, I wanted to go beyond learning academically and experience personnel at the practical level.

And I thought about how to make labor-management negotiations go well. These days, it seems that this labor-management relationship is bound to draw attention. The first thing companies suffering from financial difficulties due to COVID-19 can consider is salary adjustment or manpower reduction. However, it is not easy to obtain consent because this can be a big economic blow to executives and employees. In fact, in the case of the aviation industry, which has been severely damaged by COVID-19, labor-management conflicts have reached their peak and have often been reported in the news.

The main job of interns at the company is to receive inquiries about year-end settlement from 120,000 workers and solve their problems. And when it is not the consultation period, we are also reviewing documents such as earned income withholding receipts and various payment certificates. The hardest thing about doing this is that the situations that customers face are too diverse, and the relevant tax laws are too vast. There were so many tasks that I couldn't solve with what I studied for a short time. It was none other than the motivation to work with me that gave me the greatest strength when I was going through these problems. They helped each other a lot by sharing how they solved complex cases. As a result of the cooperation of 12 year-end settlement interns, we were able to handle the vast number of consultations that seemed impossible without any major accidents. The value of cooperation that I felt during the consultation was a kind of magic that made sense. If I had done this alone without cooperating with my colleagues, I would not have handled any counseling properly. I was able to not be discouraged by HR managers at customer companies who know much better about year-end settlement than I do because of strong motives. I will never forget the value of the cooperation I learned this time.",

As much as I worked hard, the professor cared for me, and I honestly thought that I had secured A+. In fact, I could have been satisfied with this much confidence, but I didn't. I looked for and read personnel papers separately, and visited and asked questions about pending personnel issues. I thought a lot about the difference between personnel administration and personnel management in my major, public administration. Comparing two similar but different fields, I was also able to think about whether we could create a better personnel system by combining our strengths. As a result of spending more time studying personnel, apart from my grades, I was able to completely lay the foundation for personnel management. In fact, I had only a vague goal of becoming a human resources manager before, but I was actually lacking a lot, but I think I was able to change a lot through these times.

Also, I thought it was a job where I could use both majors and teaching subjects that I am studying now. However, unlike other jobs, HRD had fewer related certificates and did not have many activities to experience the job directly, which was regrettable. In the meantime, I saw a poster about the academy and applied. Looking at the records of the previous riders' activities and this 29th activity schedule on the blog, I strongly thought that I wanted to grow as an HR expert through various experiences in a systematic organization.\n\nThere are two things I want to gain from the next generation of HR Academy activities. Competence in HR, and people. Last semester, I took a personnel management class, but the group project was replaced by COVID-19, so I didn't have a chance to play with my own feet. Through this activity, I would like to experience HR knowledge as well as the process in person. I want to get the joy of cooperation and good people.\nNote: Existing 501 characters created to delete excess amount",

In general, he is responsible for establishing mid- to long-term education strategies, establishing education systems, planning, operating, and evaluating curriculums to achieve management goals and visions. It is characterized by various educational activities so that not only new employees but also all executives and employees can work according to the company's vision and mission. \n\nI became interested in education among various fields of HR through OT of Gangwon Studies. In 2019, I heard the information necessary for my entire academic life at the orientation I participated for the first time and met with my seniors from my bachelor's degree. Thanks to that time, I was able to start my academic life without any difficulties. I prepared the OT myself for the next year and felt that this course was similar to the training of new employees. It was in the sense that it was a task of developing a strategy, taking time to train the newcomer to the organization to adapt well and perform his or her role well.\n\n\nNote: Existing 501 characters have been created and the excess amount has been deleted.",

I have lived in a local bachelor's degree called Gangwon Haksa and experienced better results than expected through cooperation at every moment. First of all, as a member of the self-governing council (the computer department), I worked with the executives of the self-governing council to ensure that there was no inconvenience in using computers and other machines in the dormitory. Because everyone was a student, the schedule was jagged, making it difficult to share tasks regularly. Therefore, we have activated 'Business Group Talk' so that the members of the current academic department can supply and order A4 paper and request repair of the machine. Due to the nature of the entire students being connected to each other, as soon as someone among the members was asked by the students, they checked the remaining members of the academic department, and they worked together to make sure that students were not uncomfortable. In addition, every May, the cyber festival planned and hosted by the Ministry of Computer Science and Technology successfully completed the event after planning how to select, proceed, and score games for about a month. Above all, the moment when I realized the value of cooperation was at the \"2019 Financial Seven Academies Joint Sports Festival.\" At that time, the students were particularly reluctant to participate in tail catching, but I persuaded my friends in the same room to participate. As a result, we were able to win the overall title for the first time in nine years thanks to our academic friends who finished second in the relevant event and also performed well in other events.",
            "q4": "I've been constantly doing something to keep growing, not being complacent in the present. I always moved so that there was no time to be thrown away, such as studying, exercising, and hobbies. It's because I felt that I would get better little by little if I did anything rather than just staying still. Last year, I came down to my parent's house due to COVID-19. To avoid being lazy, I participated in the 'Miracle Morning' challenge, woke up at 6 a.m. every morning, had QT time, and then started my day. At first, I was tired because my sleep time decreased, but I gradually used my time more fully as I adjusted. Above all, I thought I was born with morning personality, but I felt my self-esteem improved as I changed day by day. \n\nThis winter, I took a seasonal semester and worked as a kindergarten assistant teacher. And I made an accounting study and studied in my spare time to use the study that supported me at school. Although it is a non-face-to-face meeting using zoom, we have set rules so that our will to study is not broken. I felt a sense of weight as a leader while leading the study in a tight schedule, but I managed my time more thoroughly and got the results I wanted in all areas. Although I didn't try to draw a great relationship by sticking to any experiment, I did many things that I could do in a given situation, such as studying for a certificate and reading an announcer's manuscript. And I'm confident that I've grown more today than yesterday as a result of my small efforts."

            "q1": "It was interesting to be able to cultivate human abilities that cannot be replaced by machines while studying HRD major. However, in the reality that artificial intelligence beyond human limitations is constantly developing, human resources have the upper hand in technology. I thought about the possibility and necessity of HR, such as 'What are the irreplaceable advantages of humans?' 'Is that advantage necessary for organizational development?' and 'Can various individual abilities be matched with organizational direction?' I think the solution to the problem is to build the meaning of HR on your own and share various perspectives. I felt that the meaning of HR was to maximize its strengths rather than overcoming the weaknesses of its members by looking for books and examples beyond the knowledge learned only by lectures. Like HR bite's philosophy that learning grows as you share, I want to understand the overall HR through workshops and mentoring, share my thoughts with people with similar interests, run programs, and have the identity and capabilities of HR experts.",
            "q2": "Career development is an activity that strengthens one's ability to achieve one's work and life goals, and is a process in which individuals and organizations establish and manage specific career paths and plans together to meet everyone's needs. While looking for a task topic that presents creative problem-solving methods, I encountered the seriousness of the entry and exit crisis, where both joining and leaving the company are a mess. I found that the reason why the worst employment rate is renewed every year and the rate of new employees' resignation is also increasing is \"organizational and job failure,\" and I became interested in career development in finding solutions. Therefore, we planned a career development project that provides a risk-killing opportunity by applying SCAMPER technique to individuals who enter the world of work without job desire and job information at the job search stage. By complementing this, I would like to explore career development methods that can enhance organizational commitment and job satisfaction by identifying members' personal job needs through new job experiences in the actual organization, at the same time, increase organizational productivity and efficiency.",

            "q3": "Cooperation is a shortcut from frustration to earnestness. This value was felt when the process of moving forward to the goal was wrong. We participated in the DB Human Resources Development Institute's corporate management experience school and conducted a management simulation as a team of three. Our group solved each task by dividing roles among material buyers, product sellers, and manpower managers with a big goal of \"avoid the deficit.\" As a material buyer, I increased the quantity of purchases instead of offering low prices by targeting specific markets to gain competitiveness. However, human resources managers have purchased relatively few people to save basic funds. Compared to many materials, there was not enough manpower to sell them, so there was a lot of stock left. The initial assets were high, but the sales volume was low, so we finished the first round low. I was frustrated for a moment with bad results, but I became desperate to overcome it by working together while motivating each other with my teammates. It is important to buy cheap and sell expensive, but above all, I realized that the first thing to do is to build a strategy together to balance quantity and human resources. We supplemented this and discussed it together every step from the second round to explore the best way. Since we have stock left, we have achieved the final third place by expanding the insufficient manpower and converting the number of existing personnel instead of reducing the cost of purchasing materials. Through this experience, I learned that cooperation is essential to achieve the goal because individual choices move the entire direction.",
            "q4": "I want to be an HRDER who helps me develop my personal capabilities into a talent necessary for the organization. We analyzed various tasks to identify competencies based on aspirations. However, as I formed a competency model for a specific job through my major class, I found that competency modeling and job analysis are different. Unlike job analysis, which analyzes the components of work, competency modeling realized that it analyzes the characteristics of high-quality snacks and focused on \"how to work\" rather than \"what to do.\" After conducting a preliminary survey using NCS and internal and external data of the organization, BEI was conducted on actual high-quality snacks to summarize consistent behavioral characteristics to derive core competencies and behavioral indicators. The purpose of competency modeling is to foster the right people for the company, and I felt the importance of establishing the capabilities that organizations and members want to develop. Furthermore, I understood the need to develop a task that reveals the intended competency because each task has different capabilities by creating a simulation task through the evaluation of the competency model and evaluating the respondents in various situations. Based on my knowledge and experience so far, I have imagined myself participating in various activities at the next generation HR Academy, including the D project, which directly conducts demand analysis to education planning and development. For future learners and for me dreaming of becoming a future educator, I would like to explore the HR field together, set up and implement a development plan."

It was because I was able to find emotions, achievements, and even new aspects of myself that I couldn't feel in society. Eventually, based on these experiences, I decided on HR career path, and while looking into related activities, I found an activity called the Next Generation HR Academy. \nThe reason why I applied here is because I thought that time with people with the same career path would be a valuable experience for me. I think the most important thing in activities is to have a passion and a sense of mission to do. The biggest thing I felt while working as a personnel manager was to be recognized as much as I worked hard, so I hope I can be recognized by my team members and be a helpful member through future activities.",

The reason why I became interested in this field was while handling military vacation work when I worked as a personnel officer. It is vacation that most soldiers think sensitively and value. I worked on writing vacation orders for battalion members. After completing the command work, when additional suggestions came in, he refused immediately. However, I happened to see my colleagues seriously training to get a day off, and what I heard might be a simple number for me, but it could mean a lot to someone, and I was able to work with a sense of duty in doing simple tasks after that.

I was under a lot of stress at the time, but I listened to the stories of my teammates based on my experiences as a squad leader in the military. And we quickly solved the problem by interviewing the conflicting parties. In the process, I used my own car to meet them, and we ate together and tried to restore the team's morale. Of course, I don't think I should try that hard. However, thanks to my sacrifice, my teammates believed in me, so I was able to finish my assignment safely and get good grades in the class. Of course, people around me said that my actions for one assignment seemed too much. However, I thought that doing my best every moment makes good results, and I will continue to do so.

Because I had never been ignored or cursed by anyone in my life, I was so afraid of the starkness of the administrative team, where executives' nutmeg was rampant. Of all things, my shooter entered the room as soon as I came in, and in the end, I was handed over administrative affairs to the deputy personnel administration officer, who was the administrative affairs. I'm definitely listening, but I think I have a vivid memory of not having any in my head due to the tension. Once, I changed the vacation order form arbitrarily to look good. But the aftermath was huge, and I heard a lot of slang that I had never heard in my life. At that time, my self-esteem hit rock bottom, but I couldn't avoid it because it was a place where I had to stay for two years. The willingness to be recognized by those who persecuted me was on fire, and since then, I have worked overtime every day to improve my work skills. As a result, over time, the executives recognized and were able to achieve successful conclusion."

Since the second half of last year, I have been trying to access major lectures and information related to the job, but the limitations were clear. However, we have never considered the next generation of HR Academy simply as an opportunity to learn. Even before the 29th recruitment, I was able to make a firm decision to become a member someday through cafes, blogs, and SNS of the next generation HR Academy. The attraction of the next generation HR Academy, which we have seen through various media, was none other than planning and implementing a significant level of practical projects directly.

Performance management refers to presenting these performances to members of the organization as a set goal and systematically managing them to achieve the goals. Performance management has three main purposes: first, enhancing the ability to execute company-wide strategies. Second, it can lead to maximum organizational capabilities. Third, it is the development and development of individual capabilities. Performance management and 'performance evaluation' are distinguished, and performance management includes performance evaluation. Performance management leads to performance assessment, which is linked to rewards. Last semester, I took a major course called Human Resource Management Theory and was able to deal with performance evaluation in the performance and compensation unit. However, time constraints prevented us from learning in detail.

In the course of student council activities in the undergraduate school, I have thought that ability should be prioritized in order to achieve good results. And it's also true that I had a lot of pressure to be ahead of others. However, the ability-oriented way of working, rather than continuously cooperating, made it even harder for themselves. I needed more people's help for a bigger achievement, but not many people helped me. Also, I was bound to be obsessed with narrow-minded thoughts because I didn't collect other people's opinions or various thoughts while handling my work. It soon became an idea in my head and I couldn't come up with any new ideas. As such, it is clear that cooperation is essential to better performance. After realizing the importance of cooperation, I recently participated in the KPR College Student Idea Contest and won a prize. In the process of conducting weekly meetings with the team members and embodying ideas, we responsibly performed each other's responsibilities and supplemented our shortcomings.

However, ahead of the 2020 year-end settlement of earned income, which will begin in February, there were quite a few things to be familiar with about income deductions, tax deductions, and revisions this year. During the designated working hours, I was not able to study the actual part in detail due to other tasks. To make up for my lack of knowledge, I returned home from work and learned the basics of year-end settlement right away. In fact, it was the year-end settlement of many employees in the company, so I prepared hard based on the idea that I should not make a mistake. In addition, I studied by reading books published by practitioners related to HR jobs, not just year-end tax adjustment. I was able to learn about the overall human resource management and human resource development such as organizational management and human resource management plan, job analysis and evaluation, competency evaluation, recruitment, career development, performance evaluation and compensation, and education. It is true that there are many shortcomings in thinking that there is a big difference between acquiring knowledge through books and putting it into practice.

In general, selection follows the principle of efficiency/equity/fitness, and consists of document screening, examination, interview, working condition consultation, physical examination, etc.\nThe reason why I became interested in hiring is because I have experienced different performances depending on which team members I work with in team events and external activities. Through this, I also came to think that the atmosphere of the organization and the degree of achievement of the goal will change significantly depending on who is hired, and I felt the importance and attractiveness of hiring.

Many things in our society, large and small, can only be realized when various resources and abilities are combined. For example, in order to make a single cell phone, parts such as semiconductors, labor for production, software design, and design capabilities are required. But it's very difficult to meet all of these because a country or individual has limited resources and technology. Therefore, I think cooperation is necessary to complement each other's limitations and achieve their goals effectively.\n I once conducted a cup holder making class with discarded cloth in Something. At that time, we had to collaborate with foreign organizations to rent event items and spaces, and for this, we needed the ability to capture our plan well as a project plan. In addition, various tasks such as making promotional posters and designing cup holders were required. If you had done all this by yourself, it would have taken a very long time and the quality of the results would have been bad.

I started to make a habit of going to the library every morning to avoid being lazy during this vacation. At first, I often couldn't spend time productively even if I went to the library, but I was motivated by people who studied hard and gradually increased my time to focus on studying. One change called 'going to the library' has also triggered a series of other changes. I felt that I had to build up my physical strength to study for a long time, and I started taking an hour's walk every morning. Also, to use that time productively, I took a walk and studied English on a podcast. In addition, I am trying to read books instead of habitually looking at my cell phone after finishing my day. What I felt from these experiences is that I can grow up with good stimulation when I am with people who work hard for their goals. If you give me the opportunity, I will also try to make my activities at the next generation HR Academy a 'experience of continuing to grow without being complacent'."

After entering university, I was active in a Korean traditional music club called Nilirihwa. I was in the geomungo part, but I had a lot of difficulties practicing because it was an unfamiliar instrument and I couldn't read the sheet music well. Therefore, I practiced with the help of the members, and time passed and it became a performance day.

By the way, the flute was not easy for beginners to make sounds for a long time, so two members of our team played together, and we were able to sing it euphemistically by alternately playing it whenever we were out of breath. As you can see in this anecdote, my stage, which would have been a trauma if I had been on stage alone, and the whole song, which would not have been easy for the flute members alone, was able to do it safely by cooperating with each other. Through these experiences, I learned the importance of cooperation and thought that cooperation is not just a function of sharing work, but also a synergy effect through psychological bonds between members.",

First of all, I met various people and found out what kind of people fit me well, and what role I usually play in the organization. In addition, while participating in major-related academic conferences, we conducted activities to use the major knowledge learned in class by writing case management and discussing pros and cons. Through external activities, I made card news for the first time and experienced activities such as writing promotional pamphlets and participating in campaigns. Through these experiences, I practiced learning and applying new things, and while doing external activities of social welfare associations and international organizations, I found out early that I was not interested in my major and prepared for my criminal record. It was a time when I could have let go of the fact that I entered university after a hard time, but it was an experience that I learned about my personality by continuing to challenge various activities and learned about areas that I was interested in/not having."

While attending a master's degree in education, I had a goal of becoming an HR expert, and I judged that the ability I should have for the remaining two semesters was practical experience. It is important to build theoretical depth through graduate school study, but it is because you can have a higher level of expertise based on understanding and reflection on practical work. In addition, from the perspective of researchers, I think that only when the voice of the vivid educational field can be included in the study, balanced research that does not deviate from the academic field and the actual field of work can be carried out. Therefore, I would like to communicate and interact with various learners within the learning community called the Next Generation HR Academy, and broaden my knowledge of HR fields.

The reason why I am particularly interested in the field of education and training is that education and training can contribute not only to achieving the purpose of the organization but also to realizing the happiness of individual members. People try to meet various physical and social needs in their lives, but ultimately, they can approach higher-order happiness by satisfying the desire for self-realization. Education and training can serve as the most effective tool to help everyone at work challenge and move forward toward their dreams. Because learning means expanding one's possibilities.

I was able to experience the value of cooperation in person through two main opportunities while participating in an external activity called The-K Overseas Expedition for two months from July 2019. The first was in the process of preparing for external activities by 5 team members including me. All the team members had something in common that they had completed the teaching course, but their abilities such as presentation, planning, and communication skills were different. As a result, our team divided the roles to maximize our strengths and reviewed the progress and deliverables of the entire team through several interim inspections. As a result, our team was able to prepare systematically for documentation and interview screening, and we were selected for the final 10 teams and passed the foreign activities. The second was found in the topic that our team explored in our external activities. Our team visited Canadian schools and education offices to conduct interviews to explore the teacher learning community as a way to enhance teacher professionalism. As a result, I could realize that cooperation is inevitable for the growth of individuals and communities, and that a horizontal and democratic relationship must be premised for this.",

I tried many ways to improve my PPT skills because I had the motivation to do my job better and responsible. First, to focus on learning the formalized PPT patterns used in practice, we repeatedly learned what content was structured and how it was structured by referring to various references in the in-house database. After adapting to the PPT pattern often used in practice, I tried to gain insight by looking for additional color combinations and designs used in PPT through Google or books. Finally, I regularly asked my boss or other intern colleagues for feedback on the completed work, and I immediately revised the points that were pointed out. As a result of making efforts through various methods without being complacent with the PPT ability at the time, I was able to produce PPT easily whenever I started a new job, and I was evaluated by my boss that I learned my work quickly and improved PPT skills improved."

The reason why I came to think of this is because I had the experience of planning and conducting events with other members as a chairman of the organization, making better results at the same time as I felt it was worthwhile working together. In the beginning, five presidents divided the work according to their roles, and I, the director of the Treasury, tried to plan a quality event at a minimum cost, but I couldn't find a good alternative. As a result of asking for other help, I found out that there is a policy to support activity expenses in organizations for foreigners in the process of searching for information together.

Watching foreign dramas and reading books alone did not improve my language easily, so I applied for an organization where I could interact with foreign exchange students a lot, and I met with foreign friends at least twice a week to learn the language. However, just talking to exchange students who wanted to learn Korean did not improve their language well, so I decided to go abroad myself and tried to learn not only English but also French, Japanese, and their culture in the United States. In addition, I did not just learn document work such as Excel or Word in my major class, but I was able to obtain various certificates as a result of my personal study, and I am still continuing my new challenge of being a first-class comhwal.

So far, what I've realized from writing a diary is that if I had settled in the present without even pledging to do the very simple and small practice of diary, I would still be in lethargy, and personal growth comes from inner growth.

In the process, there were many difficulties due to differences in values and limitations, but each time, we moved toward our goals through dialogue and cooperation.

In the first grade 'Understanding Education Engineering' class, I received a real problem in the organization from the deputy head of the HRD department of SK Innovation and came up with a solution to this. In the process of discussing with team members about organizational convergence of overseas residents and designing educational measures, I felt that HRD was a task that had a profound impact on the emotional health, growth, and organizational growth of members.

For me, it was once very unfamiliar and uncomfortable that almost all of the education engineering classes were conducted as a team project. However, I was able to realize the meaning and value of 'together' as I proceeded with PBL one after another. There were many opportunities, but one particularly precious experience for me was a team project in the first semester of the second grade, 'Development of a Learning Transfer Evaluation Model' class. This was also a PBL class, and it was necessary to freely select one hypothetical problem situation that could be solved by education, analyze the cause, and derive educational solutions for it. My group, Park Woo-jangjo, named after the first letter of each team member, designed a coaching leadership training plan to solve the high turnover rate of new employees. For about two weeks, we conducted at least one meeting a day and a maximum of two meetings to complete the results, and the progress was somewhat slower than that of individual tasks due to the various perspectives on each decision. However, thanks to Yewon and me, who value seeing forests and presenting creative ideas, and Eugene, who knows how to see trees, and who value reviewing materialization and feasibility, there are many disagreements, but at the same time, they are rich in advice and questions.",

However, after entering college, I realized that the result of simple figures was that their value was lost more easily than I thought, and I decided to realize the meaning of my life, which was somewhat neglected, a \"good influence life.\" After thinking about what I am best at and what I should do to have a good influence, I concluded that the answer was \"mentoring\" and applied for an English instructor at the \"Hope Study Room\" supported by Samsung DS. The children I taught were children at the local children's center, and at that time, I did not receive private education other than this mentoring. Having grasped the current status of children who were not receiving academic and emotional support, I have a goal of becoming a competent and supportive mentor as well as an English teacher at an academy. And to do this, I felt that it took much more preparation and effort than I did as a peer mentor for a year and a half in high school. So I made my own activity paper to increase the interest of children who lacked the desire to learn. I wrote the example sentences myself, and I inserted the children's names in the example sentences. In addition, while listening to lectures by famous lecture instructors, I thought about how to explain easily, checked several English workbooks, and checked where to emphasize. In addition, I participated in various activities to give good influence to the extent that I could."

In my first team, I was a vocalist, a senior who was new to the drums, and a friend who was in charge of the guitar. The team members gathered to decide on a practice song for the performance, but the pitch of the original song was too low, the beat was tricky, and the melody was difficult to play on the guitar. As a result of the first ensemble, all the instruments played separately and made discord, so we couldn't make progress. The performance was not far away, so I thought about the solution, and I suggested the arrangement to the team members. By raising the pitch and slowing the beat, guitar playing and singing became easier, and drums became a little easier. Since then, I have been clapping and singing so that I can catch the drum beat every day, and my friend in the guitar role has made up for each other's shortcomings by holding me so that I don't lose my tune. As a result of trusting and helping and practicing together, we were able to decorate the stage in the first order to announce the start of the performance. Although each person had a different starting point, the moment I listened to the music that was completed together, I was filled with joy.

When I took a lecture, I always sat in the front row and took notes, and when I didn't know anything, I asked the professor without hesitation. And just before the exam, I took the initiative in organizing a study and studied with other students, and as a result of my constant efforts, I was able to get 4.42 credits in the second semester of the first grade.\nBased on these achievements, I passed the business administration and multi-major. In order to lay the foundation for HR, I learned empowerment and fairness theory through the 'Organizational Behavior' course. At the same time, I participated in a lecture by the incumbent to hear a vivid experience of HR.

In addition, I thought it was an area that best represents HR's characteristics that should consider both corporate and worker positions along with labor-management relations.

It serves as a safety device and insurance that allows an individual to stand up again without collapsing when he or she is in a difficult situation. The reason for this sense of value was because of the \"difficulties with people\" I experienced four years ago while serving as the editor of the school's sports media. In 2017, I was in the process of selecting and educating new members as the editor of the school's sports media. At that time, a member of the department I selected myself was having difficulty adapting to the curriculum and group, which led to a hindrance to the organizational atmosphere. Having been worried about not having strong leadership, such as not being able to speak bitterly as a leader, I felt a strong skepticism about the organizational management and attitude toward people I had envisioned. But behind me, who was about to collapse in a difficult situation, there were a lot of people supporting me. Starting with some of the members who noticed the situation that was placed on me, many of the members in the group held meetings on the overall curriculum, exchange, and social activities of the organization and actively participated in them.

At that time, I was becoming a \"necessary person for my classmates\" by informing the news of the school sports club, and I was not satisfied with this, but on the contrary, I wanted to be a necessary person for the sports club students. In order to meet the \"improvement of the poor training environment\" desired by sports students, I produced it as a magazine article highlighting the poor training environment facing the soccer team as a reporter for soccer. Based on my efforts and the help of junior reporters, many school members recognized the problem, and about two years later, the training environment was improved, with the playground grass being completely replaced. In this way, I was able to achieve academic growth, such as double majoring in sports and leisure studies, in the growth of becoming a necessary person for someone. \n  The second is ongoing growth, and six months ago, when I first encountered the next-generation HR, I thought, \"Am I really someone who can help this organization?\" So I gave up support during that time and started studying HR-related theories. As a result, I gained a certificate of ERP information manager and gained basic HR knowledge.

In this process, it was an opportunity to correct the concept of accounting terms that I was also confused about. I think I can grow up on my own when I give good influence to others.

However, when I first talked to my friends at American schools, my English speech and expression were not perfect, so my words and opinions were not accurately conveyed. My friend misunderstood my incomplete expression, so I tried to experience various conversations and communication to overcome it. I actively participated in classes and club activities and had a lot of conversations with my professors and friends. If I have any expressions that I am curious about, I have learned various expressions of conversation and learned how to convey my meaning accurately. I also learned how to meet and communicate with friends from various cultures compared to Korea. I experienced various perspectives while talking with my friends who presented unexpected opinions. I learned how to understand and embrace other opinions and values, broaden my perspective, and communicate opinions clearly. Through my experience as an exchange student in the United States, I realized that it is ideal communication to accurately convey and understand information and thoughts. In addition, I respected various opinions and had an attitude of communicating with a more open mind."

However, I am majoring in Korean language education and English literature and culture in college, and I do not learn anything related to human resources in my major. In the career employment mentoring conducted at Hansung University, the mentor who actually works in the HR team said, \"There are many non-members in the HR team,\" but I wanted to be a prepared HR manager. To do so, I subscribed to the magazine HR Insight and started studying computer literacy certificates. And then I got to know the next generation of HR Academy.

Apart from education to overcome shortcomings in the past, education to develop strengths is now the main focus. To do this, you need to understand the strengths of your employees and plan training programs accordingly. I thought this process was a process that I gave good influence to others. I don't give direct influence, but I think it's also a good influence for me to help people understand their strengths and make more use of them. When I majored in Korean language education and wrote a lecture plan, I made various teaching plans considering the level and personality of students. I think education and training are similar. It is difficult to create an education program that strengthens all individual strengths, but I think it is also the charm of education and training to try to do it.",

In the process, I thought about my mate, who is a candidate for chairman, and making pledges and election posters together. I thought of a rental business for art students at that time. In response to the suggestion to lend paper or paint, my mate said that if everyone uses the collected student fees only for art students, there will be opposition from humanities students, and will an art student really borrow it because there is no paper? I objected because of the necessity. So this opinion did not lead to a pledge. However, another candidate made this pledge, and other students pointed out the same thing as my mate. If I had thought of a pledge on my own, I would not have noticed this shortcoming. I learned about various perspectives in the process of making pledges, such as finding problems in each other's opinions. In addition, because it was a mate relationship, we were able to express each other's opinions without adding or subtracting, and sometimes we found that it was more effective to say it as it is than to say it in consideration of the other person. People around me say that my challenge failed because I was not elected, but I think I succeeded. In the process of preparing for the election, I have grown and I think that alone means a lot to my challenge.

As I dropped out of the application and watched the next generation of HR Academy activities through HR blogs, I realized that the application at the time did not show how much I wanted to do HR Academy, and I felt like I was snooping around. I thought it should be different when applying for the 29th term, and I wanted to gain knowledge related to personnel through career employment mentoring conducted by the university. Also, I tried to challenge the external activity management team, and if there is any activity related to HR, I tried to challenge it. Challenging doesn't always have good results, but the experience of failing has also been a good driving force for me to develop without being complacent."

Recently, the impact on resolving the labor conflict, which is a relationship between workers, has been expanding. I usually felt that the field of labor-management relations was somewhat difficult and distant.

However, compared to other members of the team, the experience of the contest was far less, so the ability to construct logic was insufficient.

At this time, I thought of a way to borrow the strength of communication and cooperation, which is the biggest strength of the team. In reverse order, when I think of the concept, a team member with a lot of experience in the contest formed the logic, and when ideas were developed, a team member with a strong design made the intangible of imagination into a PPT plan.

However, through the incumbent, I could see that the life of the advertising industry is far from the future that I had hoped for. At that time, I thought that not only the interest of advertising itself but also external life was an important part, so I decided to find another career path.

Everyone had different interpretations and different positions on the same thesis, subject, and hypothesis. We made a new attempt to understand each other's opinions rather than persuade each other's opinions, and in such an attempt, we created a process in which more rational and valid new opinions came out and divided again. The more we repeated that process, the harder and more sophisticated our research became. Again, I think that we all live with different experiences and values, none of which is meaningless and not to be ignored, but rather through the process of cooperation that integrates them, we have more comprehensive and three-dimensional results. \nIn addition, after experiencing various projects, including the aforementioned Uma project, I felt that one project requires a variety of capabilities such as marketing sense, excellent strategic planning, and proper data collection and organization.

I came to the conclusion that the reason why I wanted to stay in academia was that I had a talent and interest in learning, and that learning was a space like a sand castle created in the world. The social science that I'm interested in seems to be attached to reality in that it deals with society, but in the end, failure and success in the field of study were a world of learning that had nothing to do with reality, so I could be less afraid of failure. If I interpret this again, I was not interested in other things due to fear of failure as a direct result in reality, and I thought that I would be interested in having more direct value and meaning even if it involves risk than simple fear. I wanted to grow into a person who actively seeks new possibilities rather than excluding more possibilities simply because I am afraid of direct risks, and I am trying to experience more areas such as sustainable development, HR, and strategic planning."

For example, in order to choose a book that can be discussed well in selecting a book, we created a question that writes down the flow of discussion on the expected presentation in the existing book selection report, citing two or more grounds, respectively. Of course, not all proposals were passed at the management meeting. However, as some problems were solved, it was rewarding to see the club members being satisfied, loving the club, and participating hard.",

But I couldn't figure out how convincing my idea was by myself. I wanted to share my opinions with others about the book and express my position. However, it was not easy for me, an introvert, to join a new club after thinking about a few days before trying something new. However, I thought I would become a frog in a well if I continued to hesitate, so I decided to join the book discussion club. I discussed with people about various topics such as feminism, morality, justice, and ethical dilemmas based on the development of science. What's interesting is that in each debate, there was a person who made an argument with a part that I didn't think about it. For example, when discussing the ethical dilemma of self-driving cars, the argument that self-driving cars expressed by the opposition to self-driving cars deprives people of the right to drive was a part I didn't think of. That new perspective broadened my thinking. They were able to grow not only in academic terms, but also in various ways. I realized the importance of listening as much as speaking. I learned that in order to maintain and develop an organization, we have to go beyond just doing what's given. Above all, I found that challenges always give me learning."

After graduation, what are the jobs that can save this education? Career workshops and career development center counseling were conducted. In the process, I first encountered a job called HR. HR, a job that maximizes individual potential and work efficiency toward common goals such as recruitment, compensation, talent development, and evaluation, was very attractive. I wanted to experience it myself. Of course, it would be helpful to melt HR capabilities indirectly, regardless of whether they are active or not, but I wanted to be part of the community and learn professionally. The next generation of HR Academy is where I have a systematic curriculum and network that can satisfy that desire. I am applying for the next generation HR Academy because I want to become a growing human resources expert through OB networking, with experience from theoretical knowledge to practical practice.",

Instructional design has become more interested, feeling that it plays a very important role not only in institutions called schools for the purpose of education, but also in companies and society. While serving in the military, I experienced various education as a member of the human resources department. Based on effective instructional design, we saw that the effect was different in group life and education participation when military education was conducted and when military education was not conducted. Instructional design is considered an important factor wherever \"human resource development\" is needed because the attitude and potential of members of the organization depend on OT and workshops, which are the first buttons of clubs/external activities.",

Taking entrepreneurship as an example of a class, select a problem and work on a project to solve it. Each student's ability is different. One person's abilities are different, such as production and planning, so a project is completed only when those abilities are gathered. There was a team project to submit an Internet business report based on the contents of the law class during the semester. It was a task that required various capabilities such as legal knowledge, language, case studies, demonstration of effectiveness, and role sharing. If you were an individual, it would have been difficult to solve a deficiency in one field, but you could get good results because you complemented each other's capabilities. There may be disagreements among team members. Resolving that difficulty is also part of cooperation. There was an argument in the process of recruiting new journalists from the department and the media. Because all interviewers had different values, some successful candidates were selected from a set number of people. To address this, we have created evaluation indicators that can embrace all values through brainstorming. In this way, I think it is the value of cooperation to resolve disagreements by reflecting the thoughts of all team members, compensate for individual shortcomings, and run toward a common goal.",

I bought a plane ticket to Europe. I wanted to have a meaningful trip. I wore Hanbok and crossed Eastern Europe by bus. Thanks to you, many people were very interested in Korea. I ran into a barrier called English during my trip. It was difficult to communicate smoothly with foreigners whenever I volunteered abroad, including Japan and Mongolia, as well as Europe. As a priority, I applied for an exchange student helper in school to relieve my fear of language. Beyond the language barrier with foreign friends, I was able to experience the value of mind and communication. In the meantime, I wanted to try various things and share what I felt and learned with others. I wrote down my feelings and realizations that I faced while living as a blog. Also, I shared the insights I gained through travel and exercise on Instagram. As a result, I met new people through SNS. They were continuing to challenge me in a different field. It was another growth stimulus for me. In this way, I am constantly challenging and growing in various fields and having fun in my life."

Also, everyone has something to learn. Therefore, all members can have a positive influence on each other and grow together, and I applied because I wanted to be in the process.

At this time, in order to find an effective solution, it is necessary to obtain as accurate information as possible using various tools suitable for the situation and try to find the cause in detail. Since most of the teaching engineering major classes' team assignment is instructional design, we have always conducted a demand analysis. Until I took the 'Demand Analysis Theory' class last semester, the conclusion of demand analysis was always 'education'. So I thought that all problems could be solved through education. However, I changed my mind when I did the task of investigating the case of corporate demand analysis. There are many problems that education is not a solution, so I felt that an accurate and systematic needs analysis process was needed not to waste many people's time, effort, and money.

In particular, I prefer that the motivation for cooperation is \"people,\" and I think that an atmosphere that has a good influence on each other can achieve the value of \"cooperation.\" Because I don't want to disappoint the members I work with, I want to work harder and give feedback to each other with respect.\nI was a student in charge of writing and presenting reports in a team project. However, at the department exhibition, the production of a good-looking design was more important than the report and presentation. So I made my output in a very shrinking state. But at that time, my team members praised me a lot about what I've been doing and gave me feedback without hurting the design, which boosted my confidence. I tried harder because I didn't want to disappoint my team members in an atmosphere where we were helping each other and filling up the gaps, so I was able to improve my confidence and design skills a lot. And I was able to learn the desirable attitude when working. As we thanked each other at the end of the exhibition, we thought, 'Maybe this is the best result of 'cooperation?' So after the project is over, not just the output for the team, but also the growth of the members is the value and goal of my collaboration.",

Usually, the roles of the team members were set, so I could have written and presented the report, not the design. However, I thought that if I kept delaying others because I couldn't do it, others would grow, while I would continue to be in place. So thanks to the team members who prepared the exhibition together last year, I gained courage and started studying design tools. I developed a sense of design by listening to online lectures and looking at various design reference sites. In the meantime, a crisis and an opportunity came to me. None of the team members who were preparing for this year's department exhibition were able to handle illustration tools. So I took charge of all the parts where the design was included in the team's output. I was worried that I might harm the team, but I tried harder because I didn't want to disappoint the team members' support and expectations. It was my first design without anyone's help, so I modified it every day and got feedback from various people, identified the problems with my design and gradually improved. Like this, I felt like I had expanded the spectrum of roles I could play in the team project, so I felt that I had grown a lot. Lastly, my motto is 'Let's be a person who wants to do a team project together', and I was proud that I took a step closer to this motto."

Afterwards, I took a psychology class, and I was more interested in learning about emotions such as people's mindset and motivation. \nIn particular, I recently wrote a report on how to manage performance in detail when working online due to COVID-19. It was concluded that it forms a voluntary organizational culture and positively affects performance by setting jobs related to individual growth, and I would like to share and learn new opinions on these recent issues. \nPeople-related problems are not problems with clear answers, so the values of leaders who form and lead organizational culture are very important.

The hardest thing was to feel anxious about uncertainty about the future. But in the process, I grew up learning life lessons.\nFirst of all, \"feedback\" is as important as planning when working. It's hard to be perfect from the start. You may experience zero mistakes or trial and error.

As I saw that the student who spoke fluently in the club activities did not participate in the activities sincerely, and the student who did not speak well participated in the activities harder than anyone else, I wondered, \"Can't we fully identify the applicant through interviews?\" I would like to know the answer to my question by learning the related content at HR Academy.",

This is because problems that are difficult to solve alone can be solved relatively easily through ideas presented by many people's thoughts. In the marketing club, I was able to realize this in the process of analyzing the company with my team members and deriving strategies. We believe that cooperation has been achieved at every stage in selecting the main consumer class by combining the parts we have surveyed on Eastar Jet and presenting a new \"tour package offering options\" for the target audience. I was able to get good results with the opinions of all the team members who talked about the travel package materials, me who presented promotional methods for customers to participate in, and team members who presented new ideas by organizing ideas. Also, I was able to solve the situation through the cooperation process of collecting various opinions even when a conflict situation occurred during club activities. As more and more people unilaterally notified of their absence on the day in connection with the after-party after the club seminar, a conflict over the cost burden occurred. While sharing opinions on the problem situation at the club meeting, an opinion was suggested to pay one-third of the price for one person, and the conflict was resolved like that. As such, I think cooperation is important in that it allows us to generate new ideas and solve problems.",

When I was an active freshman, I began to steadily fill the grades that I couldn't manage because I was playing from the second semester of the first grade. I tried to record everything the professor said, and I studied less during the exam period. As a result, my grades steadily increased, and I was able to get good grades of more than 4.1 in the last semester before I moved to school. Watching my grades rise like this, I gained confidence that 'I can do it if I do it, too!' and allowed me to take on a second challenge to a new school. Although I was anxious and hesitant to initialize what I had built for two years after passing the exam, I concluded that I could pioneer my life with a more mature mindset in another university life starting in a new place based on my club activities, work activities, and major study experience over the past two years. Now that I realize that my past experiences have not been initialized, but have permeated me and made me more mature, I will try to grow steadily with another start. I want to share this new beginning with HR Academy."

I once served as an interpreter and event guide while working part-time at an international travel fair in Korea. The fraternity was held in Shanghai, China, and was planned for Chinese people, but unexpectedly, many foreigners other than Chinese, including Japanese and Russians, participated. At that time, I guided and interpreted the event to the Chinese, but I had a hard time guiding the event in detail to foreigners who could not speak Chinese and English. Luckily, I found out that some of the staff I worked with were not fluent in Japanese, Russian, French, etc., but could communicate basic, and I teamed up with them to guide foreigners who spoke other languages besides Chinese. I had a good experience to promote Korea by guiding foreigners who do not know Chinese well to actively participate in the event and introducing them to famous travel destinations in Korea. I think it is very difficult for one person to speak all languages.

While studying in China, I was spending time with Koreans more often, being very satisfied with my life. That's how my Chinese grew. I realized that living a comfortable life like this does not help improve my Chinese, so I decided to try to make a difference in my current life. In order to improve my relationship with my Chinese friends, I made a good relationship using Korean Wave culture such as K-pop and drama, which were popular in China at the time, and it was an opportunity to improve my Chinese skills by correcting real-life terms and pronunciation through my new friends. If I had not been satisfied with my current life at that time and worried about my growth, I think I could not have made my present self. It was not easy to get close to friends who grew up in different living environments with different cultures.

Each company may have a different view of talent in hiring people, but I think there is something in common because the purpose of the company ultimately results in profit-seeking. I want to know the talent image of each company through HR academy activities and finally, I want to know the common talent image that companies require.\nSecond, there are recruitments in each field, but I would like to know the recruitment process of HR among them.

Through the debate competition, I was able to grow further by seeing myself moving forward without being complacent.\nNext is when you serve in the military. Everyone thinks that military service time is a career break. But I thought it was a good opportunity to experience a special environment that I had never experienced before. Also, I wanted to develop myself without wasting my time in the military. So I read in my spare time, and I was able to win the Excellence Award at the book review writing contest held at the training center. Also, in the military, external activities were severely restricted. However, I thought I could do activities in the military, so I was able to contribute to the cultivation of military human rights through the activities of army military human rights supporters. \nAs such, I did not complain about the given environment, did not settle for reality, and constantly tried to find and develop something."

Since it was not a club with a solid foundation, the majority of the club members were lethargic and did not actively participate in activities. I thought the way to get them involved was the whip because it was my first time playing the role of a manager. The atmosphere worsened when we came up with a hard-line policy to give penalties to those who do not participate in the club, and we decided to solve the problem by having a conversation with each member through a meeting with the club executives. Every break, I visited the members and listened to the problems and solutions, and planned the educational service that most people wanted. At first, it was a negative reaction, but I took the subject I was in and had a attitude to help each other support each other through continuous communication while taking classes with mentees, and I have been looking for ways to develop positively whenever there is a club meeting. Since then, the members have actively participated in the club, and they have been selected as the best club in the volunteer category at the year-end club event.\n I was able to experience cooperation by achieving the best results that I could not make if I was alone, and it was an opportunity to realize the power of cooperation.",

Although I couldn't do many activities with my colleagues, I made friends by restoring the sociality that I had forgotten while going out to the meeting. However, at the end of the first grade, I made a resolution not to be complacent but to challenge myself, and I dreamed of the future while seriously thinking about my career.\n Although I was interested in HR, I participated in the 'job in the financial sector' in December 2020 to gain experience and knowledge. I was also interested in the financial sector, but after listening to the lecture, I thought my vision and aptitude did not fit with the field I had hoped for. Since then, I have become more interested in how the company operates by participating in accounting lectures conducted by the school. Also, it is important to have knowledge of practical work, but I have recently acquired a first-degree computer utilization certificate to improve my brand value. In addition, I am currently working on a short-term part-time job to approach HR, studying first-degree computer accounting certificate to cultivate inner and knowledge, and planning to acquire first-degree human resources for erp information management."

We gave them group assignments and individual assignments every month to try to perform their tasks and achieve results, but only a small number of people actually did their job properly.

As an organization of the International Student Council, SM-PAIR has partnered with H-PAIR to plan and conduct conferences on various academic topics every year, up to the 15th conference. The first difficulty that came to us was COVID-19. The SM-PAIR organization will work with five departments and chairmen to prepare for the conference for one year. However, COVID-19, which occurred after 2020, caused great difficulties in planning the 2021 conference. Nevertheless, as many as 25 people did not give up hosting the conference, and after numerous meetings, they succeeded in holding the first online conference in January 2021. Especially when I was struggling with funding problems, each department volunteered to participate in a contest to solve the funding problem. After the conference, the heads of each department spoke in unison, expressing their feelings of completion. \"It was an online conference that would never have been successful without everyone here.\" Through this experience, I realized that the value of cooperation can be a driving force that allows me to achieve my desired goal without giving up even in difficult situations.",

And in November 2020, I became the student president representing the department of English literature in the 2nd grade department. The first thing I did after becoming president of the student council was to reorganize my existing work according to the online situation. If 2020 was a process of preparing for COVID-19, I thought 2021 should no longer be a preparation, but should make efforts to utilize and overcome the online situation. Therefore, we wanted to hold events such as <English Film Festival> and <Online Bingo>, which can only be planned online. The <English Film Festival> was a program plan that allows several people to watch English-American movies and discuss topics together using online functions. The plan was praised by the professor as an example of wisely overcoming COVID-19, and the expectations of the students were also received at once. <Online Bingo> has also been praised for its effectiveness in creating senior and junior networking. It created a \"student association culture active in change,\" not the existing \"passive student association culture.\" I think the above efforts are examples of growing up and trying to cope with new changes without being complacent or following the existing culture as it is in the position of student council president."

We were able to achieve our goal successfully without leaving the members of the organization without leaving the members of the organization, asking them how they felt today, and practicing the difficulties together by turning on the air conditioner 10 minutes earlier than the practice time. Although the conference is over, I regularly meet the members I met at the conference and reminisce about the moment together. Through this experience, we found value in that the two words cooperation are invisible to the eyes, but we can reminisce with our members even when the organization's goals are over. It's not easy to remember all organizations even if you enter and exit many organizations. Remembering implies a feeling of longing, and I think \"remembering together\" proves that all members of the organization at the time grew up in an equal relationship and worked hard without regret.

It was psychologically and physically difficult because my body didn't follow compared to my desire to do well in every class. I came to the dorm and practiced on a mat every day, but it didn't work out. In the end, it took longer to make the completed movement than other students, so I didn't get good grades on the test. But now I've grown into a person who can handle fitness equipment, think about health, and design the future.

Thanks to this sharing of roles, I was able to prepare the play efficiently while studying at the same time. Also, I was able to get new ideas because I put my head together whenever I had difficulties even if it was a small thing.

Being with people was stressful for me. But when I looked back, I realized that it was people who made me grow and gave me the most happiness. I was able to put up a performance because there were people, and the analysis of the characters in the work that I found interesting was eventually to understand people, and even if it hurt me, it led me to change and wanted to be with me.

While preparing for the regular performance at the musical club \"Laon,\" I felt the influence of analyzing and defining each person's role, that is, their job, according to the organization's goals. After the 7th performance, the club members thought about the meaning of the planning team. In addition, the 8th management team was formed, members were recruited, and the role of the planning team was redefined, and the 8th club operation was more efficient and satisfactory. Afterwards, while studying job design and analysis in HRM lectures, I remembered what I had experienced in Raon and became more attractive.",

This is because it is often an opportunity to discuss tasks together and see what I have not thought of, and to grow together by feedbacking each other's roles and quantities. Team projects have different moods, and one of the team projects I went through last semester was a team that improved the efficiency of the assignment in a businesslike and hard atmosphere, and the other team was a team that motivated each other in a softer atmosphere. In the former, all team members were able to actively and passionately participate in difficult tasks, and in the latter, they were able to enjoy the task in a bright atmosphere. In their own ways, both teams worked together, grew up, and were able to complete the task successfully. We discussed each other's thoughts and perspectives with interest, set the topic and direction of the team project, judged each other's abilities and capabilities for efficient role sharing, and meticulous feedback on what each person did. Based on the interest and passion for each other in all the processes of the team project, it led to immersion in the task. As such, I think we can find the true value of cooperation only when we give attention to each other.",

Not everyone could get the role they wanted, so there were many members who got the part they didn't want, not me. They were trying to play the part anyway, or they were completely absent from the performance, and there were members who were helplessly filling their seats. It was hard for me to have affection for my role, but I had passion for the performance and wanted to be with the members until the end. However, it was hard for me to be satisfied with myself to adapt to reality and only perform my role. So I tried to extract maximum growth from the reality that I could change. I constantly analyzed and practiced my roles and parts and tried to show my best skills, and I filled in the difficult and insufficient parts by exchanging feedback with my fellow members during the break during practice. In the meantime, I gradually increased my weight on stage by taking on empty roles. When I came home, my whole body was sore and tired, but I enjoyed practicing and growing and adding rewards every day. After the performance, I gained confidence in my potential by hearing that my eyes first went to me on stage. That confidence remained in my memory even in my daily life and became a powerful driver of challenge and growth."

That's how I became interested in HR field, and with the dream of becoming a headhunter and human resources expert, I went to the department of business administration. However, while studying HR tracks in the actual department, I realized that HR is a field that requires endless practical judgment processes, although there are textbooks in the field of methodological HR. Therefore, I applied to learn the curriculum of the next generation HR Academy and HRM and HRD in depth, plan based on it, operate as a working-level person, and develop the ability to go toward the working-level person.\nI don't know the depth of the learning applied as a practical so far, but I want to contribute myself to society with this HR Academy.",

This is an HRD field that responds to continuous motivation and organizational adaptation.\nThe reason why I became interested in curriculum development began with 'motivation'.\n When I was in the first grade of an undergraduate student, I conducted educational studies for elementary school students. Although I educated with my own know-how, my grades tended to be lower than in regular classes. Accordingly, we interviewed each student and applied a motivational learning method on why they should study. As a result, we were able to draw significant results during the class process.\n Through this, we learned that enabling motivation proportional to our capabilities can help improve performance. In addition, I realized that developing a curriculum that can inspire employees' motivation is an essential area for HRD jobs.\n\nDelete excess with 501 characters",

However, opinions cannot always be the same, and sometimes contradictory situations occur in the process of cooperating.\nTherefore, I think the value of cooperation is an extension of the attitude to gather opinions on problems to be solved but accept them.\n When I was a senior in high school, the time has come to select new members from the Economic Management Discussion Club. However, due to the low participation of the last rider, a new recruitment process has been discussed to determine specific competencies. There were camps where applicants could not be judged by documents and interviews alone, and camps that said the number of applicants would decrease if the screening process became complicated.\nEach other's opinions in a corner made me reconsider the purpose of running the club once again and told the club members the motivation for acceptance to cooperate with each other's cooperation. After that, pieces of each other's compromise began to be put together one by one. As a result, they invested their time after school to create the optimal selection process, and a procedure was created to satisfy both camps' needs, called the \"discussion recruitment process.\"\n This led us to think that cooperation is the value of real cooperation, not the \"conflict\" between opinions and opinions and finding a compromise, but the ability to \"think\" and accept the other person's words, actions, and their meanings.",

Then, I visited the store in person to investigate the unit price of side dishes and the average number of customers.\nAfter a few days of market research, the large framework of the business plan was completed, but it was necessary to prepare a table of estimated profit and loss statements, estimated financial position statements. But when it comes to finance, there was no practical writing. Therefore, I was able to fill in the items in the account by checking the actual company's financial position table along with the major book I learned last semester.\nDuring the financial analysis, fixed costs and debt ratios on the income statement were already exceeding reality, and the causes were deeply related to social problems such as real estate, competitiveness, and incapacitation of personal capital.\n I wouldn't have even tried it if the result of this opportunity was grades. But in the process, I was able to really grow internally and intellectually, and I was able to create myself that was competitive.\nThis opportunity also taught me that \"steadiness without giving up\" is the root of my efforts."

Second, reading. There is no fixed period, but whenever I have time, I use the bookstore or library to read the books I wanted to read. Currently, I usually read books that can inspire my thoughts and awaken the existing framework. For example, the most inspired book last year was 'Selfish Genes.' This book gave us a deep insight into the genes that make up humans and gave us directions on how to live our lives. In particular, through a social transmission medium called \"meme,\" I was greatly inspired when I objectively suggested why genes in people's bodies can communicate and cooperate with each other. Finally, investment. I have been investing steadily since last summer to pay constant attention to how the world changes and what industries are developing in the capitalist society.

The idea of adjusting the tax imposed on sanitary pads by introducing a price cap to adjust the average price limit of sanitary pads was the main idea of the special law on sanitary napkins. In fact, at the beginning of the project, I used to think, \"Is this going to work?\" and limit my ideas. However, I had a daily meeting with my friends, went out to Dongsung-ro, Daegu, picket to investigate the cost of sanitary pads and the recognition of carcinogens detected, and introduced our thoughts to many people, and I experienced a growing possibility of underestimated thoughts.

Team leader Gok was mainly responsible for evaluating the dance of the team members and teaching them by learning the choreography. Because of this, there was not enough personal practice time than other team members, but because he was a team leader, he was able to avoid sharp feedback from his seniors, so Team Leader Gok was just creating an atmosphere of being a coach. However, I thought that dancing together should be in line with the team members and practice the choreography 'together', so I stayed with the members until 10 p.m. after regular practice, which runs from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., and practiced individually. In the process, I realized the lack of detail in my movements that I had not found before, and I was able to constantly study and modify my team formation by talking more with my team members. The above experience served as a starting point for me to realize, \"Oh, this is growing together,\" and it served as an opportunity to establish a new goal of becoming an \"all-genre dancer\" as well as the existing emotional genre. The reward of many people's efforts with one goal has been the driving force for dancing so far, and it has been the foundation for dancing and talking with various genres with more people through the establishment of a joint dance club with friends."

I was very surprised to learn that people's rights as workers are not properly guaranteed in our country, and even that there is a difference in their rights to be protected depending on their jobs. Nevertheless, it was unfortunate that it was difficult for them to assert their rights properly because there was no choice between entrepreneurs and workers.

The beginning of the project was a brief question-raising. Based on this, we decided to produce a toilet model suitable for Ethiopia, and we divided the roles and conducted a survey on the site based on vast data. The value of cooperation was also revealed in this process. This is because the types and fields of materials used were different, such as papers, articles, and research materials in English, so we could even consider what we could not grasp each other. In addition, I could feel the attraction of this cooperation more strongly when deciding on detailed areas of the toilet, such as roofs, ventilation holes, waste disposal methods, and funeral devices. It was because they could come up with ideas and criticize each other, and examine in detail what they could not have thought of or missed if they were alone. As a result of this, I felt a sense of efficacy and accomplishment while talking to UNOPS' staff.

I had to start anew because I had already studied meticulously when I was in high school while I was retaking the exam.

Even if I already knew it, I tried to study or solve problems that my friends around me used, such as listening to classes with as much attention as possible and changing the color combination of the pens I use or the order of solving problems. In addition, I tried to thoroughly fill the empty space of knowledge by spending at least three hours looking at the previously analyzed test papers to see if there was anything I couldn't find.

I realized the importance of personnel evaluation and became interested in it through the work I did while serving as a medical police officer.\nIn the life evaluation of the crew, the issue of fairness in evaluating the placement of the crew has been raised. I started dispatched work to solve the problem of 'relationship job transfer'. Evaluation indicators were created to leave the basis for placement as data, and the arrangement method was improved after multi-faceted evaluation. The members were assigned based on the evaluation results of the staff/senior/second-term members. There was a backlash from senior members who said they were undergoing work, but the existing successor observation log was replaced with a more simplified member evaluation. As a result, in the evaluation of life satisfaction conducted six months later, both fairness and trust items between members increased by more than 10 points to about 75.",

On the day of the final presentation, there was an unexpected absence of an American team member, but we were able to reorganize the presentation based on the cooperation process and the results, and we were able to achieve second place overall.\nOur team's cooperation process is characterized by 'respect for individuality and sharing opinions'. This is the result of reflecting as much as possible the hardships of the team members who could not easily express their opinions due to cultural differences. During the meeting, we discussed freely and wrote documents in the form of our opinion-ground-conformity about the agenda for the day and submitted them to the shared file. After that, each opinion was evaluated for validity and reflected in the decision-making. Through this process, I was able to familiarize myself with all parts of the project with my team members and easily cope with situation variables on the day of the presentation. \nIn times of crisis, cooperation shines.

I was able to constantly learn this balanced attitude through volunteer work and educational work group activities. \nI recognized the educational status of low-income students through members who did not receive private education while serving as medical police. After being discharged from the military, I worked at the Happy Learning Center in Dongjak-gu and the Education Project Group of the Welfare Foundation of Large Companies for a total of 15 months to provide them with educational opportunities. I thought empathy and communication were the best virtues, so I became a kind and good teacher to my students. However, when I checked the test results, I realized that he was not an excellent teacher. In order to accurately realize the purpose of education, accurate evaluation and judgment of the subject were needed, and evaluation of the class itself was also required. Therefore, I chose to create a student evaluation sheet, record and analyze classes, and fill out a diary. Through these processes, I was able to develop my ability to grasp and analyze situations with numbers. As a result, he was also selected as an excellent activist for the education business group. \nI want to continue to show myself growing while doing next-generation activities, thinking calmly, maintaining a gentle attitude of communication."

To this end, although I am a non-major, I analyzed HR issues, planned academic activities and interviews, and took lectures on \"human resource management\" to gain expertise. Efforts in this regard are still ongoing. Meanwhile, I came across the \"HR BITE\" articles of the next-generation blog, and I applied because I was interested in the fact that it is an organization where people with HR dreams gather to learn and share knowledge.\nLike this, I want to develop together with people with common interests and dreams through next-generation HR academy activities.

Frequent workplace movements and early retirement make it difficult to form skills and cause human capital loss from the perspective of companies, which negatively affects organizational performance. Based on this, I became interested in recruitment, organizational culture, and onboarding of new employees for efficient human resource management, and among them, I am very interested in selecting excellent talent through recruitment.\nHiring is an important starting point for HR, as Netflix calls the best welfare the best colleague, and Google HR says more than 90% of its work is hiring. Recruitment begins at the planning stage, which organizes the appropriate talent and talent requirements for the job and position, and determines the demand for the workforce. After that, recruitment will take place through recruitment activities and the process of selecting suitable talent. Recently, technologies such as AI and big data have begun to be actively used due to COVID-19, and we need to think about how to use them effectively.",

Will these competitions that keep each other in check help organizations and communities develop?\nThe economic society that has been active for the past year has industrial analysis activities. It is an activity to improve understanding of various industries by selecting industries by teams and preparing and sharing industrial analysis reports. In the first semester of my career as a member of the general academic society, there was a competition structure in this activity as each team was ranked. At the end of the semester, we shared reports written by teams, but ended up focusing only on evaluating each other, not on academic sharing.\nAlthough it is part of the various activities conducted at the conference, I thought it was a big hindrance to the purpose of the conference, and I made a simple change while working as the planning team leader in the second semester. Instead of eliminating the ranking system that causes competition, we read and evaluate other teams' reports, but we made them write what they needed feedback and what they learned. This small difference led to a lot of exchanges throughout the society through cooperation between teams, not just between teams. During the semester, we were able to share, feedback, and write more advanced reports with each other, and we confirmed that we could be closer to the purpose of academic exchange pursued by the society.\nWe found the value of achieving and developing organizational goals through cooperation, not competition.",

However, based on my passion for HR, I am starting by finding what I can do now and putting it into practice step by step. This is being divided into 1) major knowledge and 2) practical experience.\n1) I collect and organize articles such as HR Insights to analyze interested HR-related issues, and organize HR experts' thoughts and my thoughts on this.

Members who are absent because of graduation and leave of absence, organizational goals and visions that are not solidified, and a dim business model that may be profitable, and the reason for the start-up to end may vary, but I think HR, or organizational culture, is not well established. As I started my own business, I realized how important HR-related things were, such as systematicity, reporting, recruitment, organization chart, and organizational culture, but there was no place to learn about them properly. I'm still aiming to make a startup in the future. However, I thought I should have an opportunity to learn about organizational culture before that, so I looked for it and applied for the next generation HR Academy.

I thought the team was already firmly established, and I knew that there was a lack of other capabilities such as design, but I didn't think deeply about hiring. It was like learning Photoshop on its own if it wasn't enough. Then, as several members went out, we discussed hiring. However, at this time, the CEO said, \"I will hire from among the people I know,\" and brought someone without consulting with the team members properly. The person itself was good, but he was not a person with the necessary skills for our team, so I couldn't properly consider what kind of job to assign to the new recruit and what strengths there would be, so I moved on.

In fact, Mr. A, who was on the team, was known as an elite who worked well, so he took charge of almost everything. I didn't know that was the problem at first. As time continued, A felt burdened by the distribution of work that was concentrated only on him, but there was no manpower to replace A's work. Other team members had nothing to do, but A was the only one who had a hard time. On the other hand, everyone thought that B, who was on the team, was a \"person who can't work.\" I couldn't even handle the Korean program properly and it was difficult to write a plan. But he was the most active speaker of ideas at the meeting. Mr. B left this team and joined another organization, where he served as vice president to manage and lead the personnel. I learned through Mr. A that working alone is not helpful for the team, and through Mr. B, there are not people who can't work, but each person has a job. Therefore, I realized that the value of cooperation was revealed only when each person knew their strengths and used them to work together.",

So I recognized that there was no proper reporting system, that people couldn't communicate with each other, that the organization's sense of goal was not clear, and I thought that all of this was connected to \"organizational culture.\" So I went to the CEO and asked him directly for a position to manage not only the organizational culture but also the overall business operation under the name 'Operation Manager'. Since then, as an operation manager, he has introduced an SNS-type reporting system called \"Shared Diary,\" and has a simple seminar during face-to-face meetings to create a time to get to know each other by writing SWOTs for each person. I searched various media such as Trelo and Asana for job TODO management and clearly set the Trelo system. Above all, we pushed for a 1:1 meeting because we thought trust and communication between the representative and the team members would be the biggest problem. The CEO told me to have an interview with all five team members once a week, which allowed me to restore my trust a little. I don't think my efforts are in vain. Rather, it was an opportunity to continue to study organizational culture, and I am continuously looking for HR even after startup activities are over."

With this interest, I chose personnel management as a detailed major, but I came to know the next-generation HR Academy while looking for related academic knowledge and practical exchanges about personnel management that are insufficient due to school work.

Labor-management relations are organized into fourth-grade classes at business schools because there is a social demand that organizational members and companies should pursue, including laws and policies, rather than traditional business administration.\nAs I majored in business administration and was interested in law, I took subjects such as civil law and labor law at university and thought that labor-management relations (labor) could be related to companies.

Cooperation complements and compromises each other for what an individual cannot do or is difficult to do, resulting in high-quality results. Even if it's something you can do alone, cooperation allows people to do better and finish things with less effort. In short, the value of cooperation lies in efficiency, effectiveness, and economy. Experience has shown that working with others makes things more strategic and easier. For example, when I was assigned a task by a higher-level department while serving in the military, I solved the task by worrying with my colleagues and my successors. Even in a class society, ideas can come out to anyone, so if you put in a rough frame, you think about effective measures and give opinions. Through this, I have experience in performing one task effectively, such as preparation and administration of events in the unit. Working with senior and junior rather than working separately will inevitably result in so-called synergy as well as efficient methods. This becomes a know-how in later life and has the effect of being continuously delivered. Likewise, the behavior of organizational members in a company will inevitably involve cooperation with teams, departments, business units, and other companies. The important thing here is to reasonably coordinate the interests and opinions of the unit organization.",
            "q4": "In the academic field, I took various courses in personnel management and service management in the business department, which is my main major, to grow. This is because personnel management is originally an area of interest, and service marketing and service OM are increasing in the proportion of the service industry in the Korean economy, so it was judged that services would ultimately be involved in all industries. In addition, I was interested in law, which is a public norm that has a wide influence on society, so I took civil law, labor law, and criminal procedure law, and I will take constitutional general theory and criminal law in 21-1 semester. I want to use the knowledge that has not yet reached the basic level as a search for facts that can help me play a role in society by refining it more deeply and elaborately. In other areas, I go to the gym every day to do weight training for my health. The first time I went to the gym was the winter vacation of high school, and I started to improve my very thin body and weak physical strength. At that time, I worked hard at the gym for about six months, and I could clearly feel that my body became healthy in its own way. What's unfortunate is that after I became a senior in high school and went to college, I barely exercised, but I recently started exercising again after seeing my exhausted body. What I felt here is that even if it's a small amount of time, you should not be bothered and put in your effort and passion steadily."

I tried to talk continuously to find out the cause of the sudden change in attitude. As a result, I found that the feedback method was a problem. At that time, when assignments were uploaded, they were often modified and re-uploaded without discussion. As a result, the team member was struggling because his opinions and capabilities seemed to be alienated. \nTo solve the problem, we reduced online meetings and conducted offline meetings right after class. They also agreed to take responsibility for the tasks they shared and not to engage in the deliverables even if they gave feedback. As a result of providing useful information to constantly communicate and develop each other based on trust in the team members, we recovered our teamwork and received high scores.

So I made a resolution to become a person who constantly challenges and improves in college and social life. \nThis commitment also influenced the volunteer work of the museum docent. As a result of my efforts to explain it to the eyes of various visitors, I was able to work as a part-time job.

All participants participated in the entire presentation process, including in-depth opinions on the topic of the presentation, what feed to put in the PPT, what message to put in the PPT, what content to highlight and use non-verbal expressions.

In the meantime, due to the order to reduce personnel and soldiers from the upper level, the crisis of dismissal came. I had a strong urge to live. I survived by voluntarily building data and writing reports, and increasing my job value by making my own work concentrated on certain executives. After that, I had the urge to become a personnel expert in the unit! To this end, the HR department, which has to self-directed record of personnel-related military laws, administrative regulations, and systems that even executives do not know, has the ability to answer people's needs. Of course, I had a higher job value than before, so I was responsible and workload, but I became recognized by everyone and the commander of the unit, and I lived an active military life with a sense of accomplishment through impulse in the organization of an army that only performed the tasks required.\n\n I think it's an impulse to make people as passionate beings, not as machines. Even in trend-sensitive HR, if this impulse leads to action before it cools, it will continue to grow and further lead to performance. And I want to unleash this impulsive passion in the next generation of HR Academy."

In addition, members can grow by sharing their unique experiences and information with groups through cooperation. However, I believe that efficient work performance and individual growth of members cannot be achieved without 'communication'. Therefore, the key to cooperation is communication.\n\n\nThe existing organizational system of the Korean University Student Education Donation Group, which I am currently active in, was in the form of a matrix, and communication between different departments within the same project was not smooth. The lack of rapid sharing of progress between departments has led to job inefficiency, and the burden of success or failure on certain members has been heavy. Therefore, through internal meetings, we periodically set up opportunities for project-by-project support and cross-departmental feedback. \n\n\nCommunication between departments became easier to reflect different perspectives on the project, and mutual feedback made it possible to flexibly adjust the division's role distribution. Unlike in the past, when the work was centered on executives due to the lack of communication, the project succeeded in the final launch as the opinions of many members were effectively reflected. This allowed us to realize how important \"communication\" is to bring out the value of \"growth.\"",

There were not many teachers who applied because the conditions were not good, but I submitted an application because I wanted to be a teacher who could actively communicate with students.\n\n\nMy role at the ministry site was kindergarten service. It was to create a play program for local infants with friends from the youth club. Because I had to communicate with infants in English and play without being scared, both the children in the youth club and I had a hard time at first. In order to facilitate the program and renew the atmosphere, I gathered with the youth club children in advance to properly distribute the roles and encourage them every time I finished the day. It was not easy to communicate with students with different empathy and age differences, but I tried to overcome the awkwardness, recalling that I had no chance to talk to the children 24 hours a day.\n\n\nEventually, through these efforts, we were able to form a strong bond with students, and we were able to rely on each other and have more honest conversations.

Because it was a time, I thought at first that I would only do what I had been doing until the prolonged COVID-19 situation was normalized and just the status quo.

Contrary to my belief that face-to-face contact is the only way to achieve it, and there are huge limitations online, it went very smoothly to talk to other people, have meetings, and teach children economics. Rather than just waiting for this situation to calm down, which I don't know when it will end, I thought it would be a desirable direction to adapt to the situation and find what I can do.

            "q2": "HRD is the field of developing corporate human resources. In order to improve the company's management performance, HRD is invested to plan and implement training on human resources. I'm a person with an endless passion for self-improvement. In the process of overcoming the experience of always being sluggish in English subjects during my school days, I devoted my passion to self-development. After receiving a TED talk about the impact of language skills on life, I decided to focus on improving my English for the future of my life. My problem was that I always didn't have enough time to solve English problems because I changed English to Korean. It was important to understand the English text within a given time, such as asking the subject in the given text. Based on the analysis, I came up with a solution, and as a result, I was able to go to my target high school. I became interested in the process of analyzing individuals and devising solutions to achieve my goal and dreamed of becoming an HRD expert.",

            "q3": "I think the value of cooperation is 'discovery of the unexpected'. There was a time when I entered the Department of Education and Engineering with a small interest in education, but I was in a slump because I couldn't decide my career path. What I learned from this period is, 'Let's experience a variety of things first. In fact, when I looked around my friends, I thought I was the only one who was stagnant, so there was a contest that simply thought, \"I should do something!\" It had nothing much to do with the field of education, which I was interested in, and it was a contest related to artificial intelligence, so I was worried about whether I could do well. However, after discussing and preparing with friends from various majors who participate in the contest, I was able to raise my self-esteem by suggesting unique ideas and having some planning skills. Rather than focusing on a specific field, I want to find my potential and grow in a field that I didn't know. Without this process of cooperation, I certainly wouldn't have found this capability. Through cooperation, we can look at each other from an objective perspective and make true discoveries in objective situations.",
            "q4": "My passion for the work has grown since I conducted the lecture at the request of the head of the English academy. I had a lot of mentoring experience, but they were all in the form of educational donations, so they simply served as learning assistance, but at first, it was a burden to lead two hours of classes alone. I did my best to prepare for the class with responsibility, and I tried to analyze the students' tendencies and academic ability to conduct a complete class and make up for the regrets I felt with the academy teachers when I was a student. Because it was a class with a lot of variables, there were many times when it didn't flow in the direction you wanted, and there were many times when you didn't know how to solve the problem. However, I always tried various ways to proceed with the best class, always reminding them that my two hours of class could be remembered until any future moment and that what I teach could play a big role in future learning. As an educational engineer, it was a part-time job like a field trip for me, learning that I had to focus on students and pay great attention to their emotions because I was an elementary school student and asked for advice from my fellow teachers. I had no regrets because I did my best every moment, and it was a valuable experience that I always remembered the memories with the children I taught until now, and my passion for education grew even more."

In the process, I didn't feel like I had many opportunities to gain HR-related experience, and I came to know the next generation HR Academy. It was attractive that it consisted of programs such as HRM projects and HRD projects, not just education. In addition to this, the fact that I can interact with various people, including Homecoming Day, also came as an advantage. \na springboard to growth\nSince I haven't done many HR-related activities, I want to grow in HR field through this activity. I was able to meet various people through new activities and see myself growing through them. I want to grow up and find a new look in the next generation HR Academy, and get closer to my goal of becoming an HR professional.",
            "q2": "I am most interested in the field of education and training. This field is mainly called HRD, which usually refers to educational work. Specifically, it performs various tasks such as establishing an education strategy to provide job-related education to employees, supporting career development for employees' career development, organization development, and organizational culture. \n\nAs I participated in the career camp for middle and high school students hosted by the Gimhae Career Education Center for two years as an assistant instructor, I became interested in the field of education and training planning. In 2018, I was able to understand the needs of children by running the camp as an assistant instructor and analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the camp. Since then, I have participated as an assistant instructor team leader in the career camp planning meeting for high school students in 2019. I became interested in educational planning by presenting opinions, including what I was disappointed in at this meeting, and naturally decided to work in the field of education and training.",

            "q3": "I think the value of cooperation is the growth and achievement of an individual through the achievement of a community. I got this idea from my experience at the UN Youth Peace Camp. The camp is a program in which descendants of UN participating countries from abroad visit Korea and conduct various exchange activities in English. My confidence dropped because I had no experience in the camp. However, we worked together to win various games and talked a lot while planning a tour course for a team mission in Seoul that promotes Korea. Through this, we were able to move forward with one goal even when we were working on a team building with foreigners. On the last day, a contest and a PT presentation were held at the same time to collage photos taken based on the tour course planned. As a result of planning a collage centered on creative team members, I won second place. Since then, his experience in this camp has also been demonstrated at the Shinnam Bangcho Cheong Yeonsu, which he participated a month later. Each Korean had a birdie and a team of two Koreans was made up of Yeonsu. At that time, there was a small communication problem with the team members and Buddy, so as a team leader, I tried to reduce the communication problem in English as much as possible and tried to increase teamwork. Since then, we have been able to get a high response from the team mission announcement through cooperation.\n\tAt this time, we were able to grow through community achievement in the previous camp, and I think we were able to bring out community achievements together in other camps afterwards.",
            "q4": "My new year's goal during college was 'Let's do new activities every year!' To keep this goal, we did at least one new activity every year. After spending about two and a half years like this, there was a moment when I was tired. For the first time in my college life, I thought, \"Isn't this enough?\" and \"Should I do this?\" I bet you wouldn't even know the next generation of HR Academy if you'd been complacent at this moment because you truly felt enough. \n\tIt was the activities of the Gyoji Editorial Committee that kept us from complacent even in the exhausting moments above. Time was running out because I had to compile two school papers a semester. At this time, I read the sentence 'Time waits for no one' that I wrote in my notepad again. If I didn't do anything in a tired state, I realized that I would only stay in a tired state, and I wanted to do anything, such as borrowing books from the library. Therefore, I tried to spend a lot of time outside, such as taking a walk or writing articles at a cafe. As I regained my own pace, my tired thoughts began to disappear, and I also found a solution to keep myself busy to maintain this state. Since then, I have started to apply for more diverse activities such as language tests, graduation tests, and public relations groups. This became a turning point and naturally led to better understanding and growth of yourself."

As a result, I felt the most proud when I learned something and taught others what I learned, and realized that I really enjoyed the activity even though my body was tired. Also, while working part-time at Olive Young, I found that I enjoy dealing with people. I thought HR field was the job that fits my tendency. However, I applied because I saw the 29th recruitment announcement of the next generation HR Academy while thinking about how to study this field because I thought that there was a limit to obtaining related knowledge only with school classes.\nWhat I want to gain from the activities: Above all, I want to gain practical knowledge of HR field. I want to learn and develop practical experiences of incumbent OB seniors and experience the systematic curriculum of the academy.",
            "q2": "I think the field of education and training can be explained by the process of baking cookies. When baking cookies, first use a cookie mold to make the dough into a single shape. The shape is the same, but then it's the same depending on what you decorate, but a variety of cookies are completed. Likewise, I think organizations have a certain large framework of rules, but they pursue diversity within them. I think the means for this is education and training. Therefore, I think education and training can be defined as suggesting the direction of a common large framework of organization and then letting each member exercise their capabilities within it.\nThe reason I became interested: I have experienced everything from being educated in the organization to being in charge of education. Starting as a member of the student council and the English newspaper, I took charge of the department, received my own education, and educated the new member. I have also been trained and done part-time jobs. In this process, it was interesting to learn the values of the organization, the direction of behavior, etc., and to convey what I learned to others.",

            "q3": "The value of cooperation, I think, is that 'you can't act alone or create something difficult with meaningful results.' \nWhen I was a freshman, I took a class called Startup Design Thinking. The main purpose of this lecture was to develop business items through group activities. As a result, our group developed an item that purifies polluted indoor air, which at first started with my complaint that the classroom simply smelled of food. After that, the team members shared their unpleasant experiences in the subway, library reading room, etc. Through mind maps and post-it discussions that were part of the class, we discussed specific ways to solve this problem. The idea was embodied with a scent capsule that can purify the air by stepping on it, and a scent grenade that can purify the air in a wider range of spaces, and even a prototype, even though it was a model. \nThrough group activities in this lecture, I felt the value of cooperation. This is because words that could have been dismissed as complaints from sensitive people led to business items through a number of cooperations and even prototyping. If I were the only one doing the activity, I would have thought in my mind that someone must have eaten in the classroom, but I think I was able to materialize the idea through communication and cooperation with my team members.",
            "q4": "1. Experience in school activities\nWhile working in the student council, I received complaints from students that the existing snack event menu is always like hamburgers. If I decided on the menu for the snack event with hamburgers, I could have maintained the price with all the existing companies and carried out the event comfortably, but I didn't want to. We were able to introduce new menus such as Anbutter and Steak Truck at that year's snack event by looking at the menu of other school snack events on the Internet and analyzing the menu of celebrities' snack trucks. This is an experience that I was proud of because I felt that my efforts were not in vain as student associations in other departments benchmarked it later. \n2. Experience at a part-time job\nAt first, I was confident that I had some knowledge of cosmetics because it was my hobby to watch videos of beauty YouTubers. However, the reality was different from what I expected, so at first, I was afraid to talk to a shy customer about product inquiries and talk to them. \nI will continue to work part-time from now on, but I thought it would not work like this. After that, I remembered cosmetics that were sold a lot in the store, searched after work, and read reviews. Also, I searched and searched for in-house training videos or purchased and used them myself. In addition to knowledge about cosmetics, I learned how to sell to customers from marketing techniques I learned at school, how to buy, and how to talk from colleagues around me. As a result, I was able to recommend the product with more confidence."
